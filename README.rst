Automation Mojo Waiting Module - mojo-waiting
=============================================

This package provides support for enhanced context based waiting.  This module will greatly enhance the
information presented when a wait timeout occurs.  Wait contexts are particularly useful for distributed
automation.  Distributed automation scenarios required lots of wait loops in order wait for the effects
of an effect to distributed throughout the distributed system.

The waiting code patterns used are designed to present the best results in test stacktraces presented
when a wait fails.  This makes the `mojo.waiting` module perfect for use with
test frameworks such as `pytest` and `testplus` that show code context in the error
report stack traces.

Another important aspect of the `mojo.waiting` module is that it uses `datetime`
timestamps and `timespan` for lengths of time so timeouts in error reporting are easier
to interpret.

The following is an example of how the `mojo.waiting` module is used.

.. code:: python

    from ctxwait import WaitContext, wait_for_it

    def some_wait_helper(wctx: WaitContext):
        finished = False

        // TODO: Check if something is finished, the code and variables used
        //       here will show up in any tracebacks from pytest or testplus
        //       because the timeout is being raised in the appropriate scope.

        if not finished and wctx.final_attempt:
            whatfor = "Test timeout"
            toerr = wctx.create_timeout(whatfor)
            raise toerr

        return finished

    wait_for_it(some_wait_helper)


The `wait_for_it` method has many different parameters that can be used to override the
behavior of the wait loop.

.. code:: python

    def wait_for_it(looper: WaitCallback, *largs, what_for: Optional[str]=None, delay: float=DEFAULT_WAIT_DELAY,
                interval: float=DEFAULT_WAIT_INTERVAL, timeout: float=DEFAULT_WAIT_TIMEOUT,
                lkwargs: Dict[Any, Any]={}, wctx: Optional[WaitContext]=None):
        """
            Provides for convenient mechanism to wait for criteria to be met before proceeding.

            :param looper: A callback method that is repeatedly called while it returns `False` up-to
                        the end of a timeout period, and that will return `True` if a waited on
                        condition is met prior to a timeout condition being met.
            :param largs: Arguements to pass to the looper callback function.
            :param what_for: A breif description of what is being waited for.
            :param delay: An initial time delay to consume before beginning the waiting process.
            :param interval: A period of time to delay between rechecks of the wait conditon
            :param timeout: The maximum period of time in seconds that should be waited before timing out.
            :param lkwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the looper function

            :raises TimeoutError: A timeout error with details around the wait condition.

            ..note: The 'delay', 'interval' and 'timeout' parameters will be ignored if the 'wctx' parameter
                    is passed as the wctx (WaitContext) parameter includes these values with it.
        """
        ...

The `wait_for_it` function must be passed a method that follows the `WaitCallback` protocol.  The function
can have variable arguments and keyword arguements but the first parameter to the `WaitCallback` method
must be a `WaitContext` object.
