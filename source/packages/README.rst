You should not put a '__init__.py' file in this folder.  The sub folders
of this folder are the root of your packages.

   packages/org
   packages/blah

So when you import with python from these packages, you would import like:

.. code:: python
   import org
   import blah

You may have a deep package so import with full names if so.

.. code:: python
   from org.something import Thing
